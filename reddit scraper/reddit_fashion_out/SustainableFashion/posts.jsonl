Most clothing today is made of plastic-based fibers, like spandex, nylon, and polyester, which shed tiny fibers every time they‚Äôre worn, washed, and dried.¬†Those tiny shedded fibers are called microfibers, and can also come from carpets, curtains, and other household items, making our homes a hotspot for airborne microfiber pollution. \n\nSimple Steps to reducing exposure to microplastic fibers in your home: \n\n* Wear and wash items wisely - Avoid synthetic clothing fabrics and opt for natural fibers, such as cotton, hemp, and wool whenever adding new items to your closet. When it comes to the synthetic fabrics you already own, try washing them less frequently, since garments shed microfibers every time they‚Äôre washed and dried. You can also install a microfiber-catching filter to your washer and adjust your machine washing settings. Washing full loads with cold water can significantly reduce fiber shedding.\n* Shop secondhand - Fast fashion and cheaply made textiles shed more than well-made fabrics, and the highest amount of shedding is usually in the first several washes. By thrifting or buying secondhand, you not only save money and reduce waste, but also bring home clothing that has already ‚Äúpre-shed‚Äù most of its microfibers. Just avoid items like brushed polyester blankets and unhemmed clothing, which are some of the worst microfiber culprits.\n* Choose home goods with natural materials - Microfibers don‚Äôt just come from clothing ‚Äì carpets, curtains, and upholstered furniture are common sources too. Whenever possible, opt for rugs made of natural fibers like wool or jute. For upholstery, consider natural textiles such as organic cotton or hemp.¬†\n* Share with others - Join 5 Gyres‚Äô [\\#DoLessForThePlanet campaign](https://www.5gyres.org/dolessfortheplanet) and take the pledge to commit to small lifestyle changes that lead to big environmental benefits. Then, share the pledge with more people in your circle! Every small action contributes to the larger goal of protecting our oceans, air, and soil from the harmful effects of plastic pollution.\n\n  \nFor more [tips](https://homeplanet.grove.co/blog-posts/5-ways-to-reduce-microfiber-exposure-in-your-home?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=july_reddit).", "author": "kalemegranola", "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 10, "link_flair_text": null, "over_18": false, "is_self": true, "removed_by": null, "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "stickied": false, "awards": [], "comments": [{"id": "nbcv4cg", "link_id": "t3_1n3adss", "parent_id": "t3_1n3adss", "author": "chaoscorgi", "body": "how do you handle microfibers in athletic wear (e.g. yoga leggings)? garment bags or catchment?

All of my fabrics are 100% natural fibres and it is absolutely possible for natural plant dyed textiles to be completely non toxic and for the mordant (the fixer) to also be safe and non-soluble and if cared for correctly, for the colour to last. The colour isn't as steadfast as toxic petro-chemical based but when it fades it does so beautifully, whereas in my opinion, synthetic clothing can look 'tired' very quickly. Natural fibres have an affinity with natural dyed and because of the time it takes to create a naturally dyed textile I would say that most often a quality fabric i used, which also gives it longevity.\n\nI do multiple wash tests on my fabrics and am very pleased with the results.\n\nIf you'd like to know a bit more about natural dyes I have a page on my website https://www.sarahpoland.com/what-is-natural-dye.\n\nI also have a page about Why I Natural Dye Clothing [https://www.sarahpoland.com/why-i-natural-dye-clothing](https://www.sarahpoland.com/why-i-natural-dye-clothing)\n\nThey do need caring for like a treasured piece of clothing. If you go down the route of natural dyeing yourself you'll appreciate the time and care it takes to achieve the colour. If cared for, washed at a low temperature with a pH neutral soap, not left in the sun (eg the back seat of the car) they can last well and evolve beautifully.

Most brands do not have a storefront and even those that do don‚Äôt carry all sizes. For example, I am tall and the storefronts that exist generally don‚Äôt carry tall sizes. To add to the challenges, ordering the tall version of a size is not the same as ordering the regular version of a size. For example, I can‚Äôt go to the Madewell store and try on their jeans and see that a size 10 fits me and then go home and order a 10 tall, because the scale of a tall sized pant is different from a regular sized pant so they are completely different pants and a 10 tall fits differently than a 10 regular. I also can‚Äôt alter a 10 regular because it‚Äôs not possible to add 3 inches to the inseam of a regular inseam pant and have it look normal. \n\nWhen ordering online I always take my measurements when ordering, but it‚Äôs easier to order the two most likely sizes and see what fits best and return the one that doesn‚Äôt fit as opposed to ordering one and going through the month long exchange process and hoping that they still have the item in stock that I want to order in the right size.\n\nAnd honestly, this is completely on the clothing companies and their shitty business practices.

I really love the shein \"cami tops\" and \"y2k mesh tops\", but i can't find anything similar anywhere apart from depop (where they also resell shein and almost always raise the price unreasonably much for a second hand item).

Here's the thing: people in most of human history just owned way less clothes than us. They'd get like, one new outfit a year, IF that. The reason most of us see spending $100+ on a garment as crazy is bc we're used to buying like 20+ new garments a year. If we bought clothing at the same rate as humans usually have, suddenly those higher prices become affordable. \n\nThe key to finding cool clothes while avoiding fast fashion is to become more knowledgeable about clothing and its construction. If you search for \"y2k tops\" on depop you're going to find a bunch of \"y2k inspired\" fast fashion or a bunch of resellers putting the price super high. But if you go somewhere where trendy resellers aren't quite as prevalent - like poshmark or ebay - and search just the specific type of item you want (like \"mesh tank top\" or \"mesh camisole\") you'll be able to find people listing actual vintage items from their closets that they've had since 1999. You have to give up on using style keywords like y2k or cottagecore or whatever and search for the specific things that you want. And if you aren't sure what specific items you want, then you get to do the really fun part - getting inspiration! You can find people whose style you like on social media, sure, but there are also lots of amazing archived fashion magazines, ads, and catalogs from the entire past century. For y2k style, I'd check out old Delia's catalogs and old copies of Seventeen or Vogue. You can even find hard copies for sale on ebay if you want. \n\nI'd also suggest looking up local antique fairs and flea markets. There are frequently sellers who have tons of stuff from the 90s/early 2000s. And, if you're interested, learn to sew - or at least to modify your own clothes. A lot of really simple modifications (like cropping and hemming something) are really easy and can be done without a sewing machine. There are also lots of easy ways to dye clothes at home using an old pot, and you can experiment with adding small details to clothes that make them special - like unique buttons, changing out the belt for something cuter, etc. \n\nYes, the hunt is harder when you don't shop fast fashion, but in my opinion that's the entire fun of it! I've reached the point where I hate walking into a store and immediately seeing cute things laid out for me. I don't want the store to choose what I buy.

The constant craving for new clothes isn‚Äôt about personal style anymore. It‚Äôs about addiction to convenience and overconsumption, and fast fashion has totally warped our sense of what clothing should cost or how long it should last.\n\nI completely agree with you. We‚Äôve been sold this idea that shopping is self-expression, when really it‚Äôs often just impulse buying dressed up as identity. Giving up fast fashion isn't just a personal choice. It‚Äôs a necessary shift if we care at all about labor rights, the planet, or even real creativity in fashion. And yes, it takes more effort to search, learn, and maybe even sew or thrift creatively, but that‚Äôs part of the value. It slows us down and helps us connect with the things we wear in a more meaningful way.\n\nPeople say sustainable fashion is ‚Äúinaccessible,‚Äù but I think what‚Äôs truly inaccessible is the illusion of choice fast fashion gives us. Most of it falls apart, copies the same trends, and ends up in a landfill. Real style isn‚Äôt about having 40 trendy tops. It‚Äôs about wearing something that tells a story and lasts.\n\nSo yes, the hunt might be harder, but I‚Äôd rather build a wardrobe slowly and intentionally than keep fueling a system that exploits both people and creativity.

The brand I work for has a very robust auditing program so all of our factories are paying fair wages and have good work conditions. In Portugal, the construction cost of a basic button-down men's shirt is around 16-17 euro. The 100% cotton is about 9 euro/m, and that's wholesale cost with a significant discount as a special customer (it retails for 4x that). About 13 for the whole shirt, so let's say 30 euro for make and fabric. Add a couple more euro for buttons, tags and labels. We retail this shirt for around 200 euro. Seems like a big jump right? Well, besides fabric, trim, and make cost, that retail price has to pay for: shipping, warehousing, distribution, packaging, building leases, energy, insurance, business rates, wholesale margins, and employee wages and benefits, AND profit.\n\nSo, you can imagine that a shirt that costs 20 euro retail, like you can find at H&M or Zara, how little they must be paying for wages and materials.

Your brother should thank you for the free market research üòÖ\n\nThe brand positioning of natural fibers over synthetics is honestly really appealing to a lot of consumers right now, but I agree the silhouettes and styling are missing the mark.\n\nI‚Äôd do some research on some high end but more niche brands like:\n- Popflex Active (Cassey, the owner/designer, has a GREAT social media presence engaging with what her customers want on a very specific level ‚Äî like waistband thickness, how ‚Äúoversized‚Äù an oversized t-shirt should be, etc)\n- Set Active does really beautiful coordinating sets with nicely defined subcategories of different fabrics. I think the key to offering a large lineup like you‚Äôre talking about with 100+ colors/styles/fabrics is making it easy for customers to find exactly what they want in terms of fit and feel\n- Wooland and Branwyn are two of my favorite brands that do majority merino wool garments but aren‚Äôt necessarily marketed as ‚Äúadventure‚Äù gear like Smartwool or Patagonia\n\nLastly, if you‚Äôre selling to people who know merino wool, they know that a small percentage of synthetic fibers can be better than a 100% wool garments because a small amount of nylon in the yarn makes the fibers stronger. I‚Äôd rather buy a merino garment that‚Äôs 10-20% nylon specifically because it‚Äôs going to be more durable than the same garment in 100% merino. Merino is an AMAZING fiber and I‚Äôm always evangelizing it to everyone in my life, but it has strengths and weaknesses like any other fiber.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1749738933, "created_iso": "2025-06-12T14:35:33+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "mxe6mq5", "link_id": "t3_1l85815", "parent_id": "t3_1l85815", "author": null, "body": "Yeah just what the world needs.

A lot of active wear I've encountered can't withstand the demands over time and they wear out really fast - the best natural material exercise clothing I've found still gives out after less than a year. A pair of (e.g.) 100% organic natural material shorts that you have to replace frequently is not sustainable, even if it's way more comfortable and healthy for my body than the synthetic options. It still takes a lot of labour, materials, land, water, energy, fuel, and time in order to grow, harvest, process, weave, dye, cut, sew, and distribute the materials. All that for less than a year of use, sadly doesn't add up.\n\nAlso, once it's discarded, even if it's biodegradable most people don't have the means to properly compost it, and anaerobic decomposition in landfill creates a lot more methane than composting. Most figures I've seen for the impacts of biodegradable goods will only account for the most efficient composting setup, which is unlikely to happen for most people.\n\nAll that aside though, the idea of 100% natural material exercise clothes (looks like mostly US cotton and Finnish wool) does sound really nice from the perspective of actually wearing it. It's cool that you've got a plant dyed option too, I've not seen that before. The 'spiritually pure' description is pretty icky to me, I've seen that language used in other less wholesome contexts, but I can see the marketing angle you're going for. I will also point out that it is not \"made 100% by nature\" - the materials may be 100% natural materials, but the clothes are made by people.

But until recently scant research existed on how chemicals in feminine hygiene products and personal lubricants may affect women‚Äôs health....\n>\n>A recent report by the nonprofit Women‚Äôs Voices for the Earth (WVE) points out that feminine hygiene products may use ingredients that are known or suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), carcinogens, or allergens....\n>\n>‚ÄúMost of the vagina is covered with multiple layers of dead and dying cells that do a lot to protect it against infection, but [this] is nowhere near the thick leathery surface of our skin,‚Äù says Cone. ‚Äú**The vaginal epithelium ‚Ä¶ is highly water permeable in a way our skin is not.**‚Äù\n>\n>Because mucous membranes in the vagina and vulva rapidly absorb chemicals without metabolizing them, researchers have even explored the possibility of delivering drugs vaginally. **One study found that vaginal application of estradiol, a synthetic estrogen, resulted in blood serum levels 10 times higher than those following oral dosing.** But while rapid absorption works well when a patient needs a drug delivered rapidly, it may also expose women to higher levels of chemicals from feminine hygiene products than manufacturers intend.\n\n\nIf no one's bothered to check to see if *feminine hygiene products* are safe for use near the vagina, what makes you think they've checked a much more new concept like PFAS exposure and clothing?\n\nHere's an article on PFAS exposure via clothing, which didn't even touch on vulva exposure:\n\n>The group points to research demonstrating that fabrics with that type of PFAS, called side-chain fluorinated polymers, emit volatile chemicals into the air and, when washed, into the water....\n\n\n\n\nSo PFAS can leach into water when being *washed*, does that mean that it can't leach out from your swimwear? I'd say no.\n\n\n\n>In general, however, it's harder for PFAS chemicals to enter the body through transdermal exposure than through the digestive system, said Dr. Ned Calonge, associate dean for public health practice of the Colorado School of Public Health who co-authored the national academies' report.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/pfas-in-clothing-household-items-consumer-products-forever-chemicals/\n\nSee, they just center skin exposure, not vaginal or vulvar exposure, even through over half of the population has those body parts.¬†So, we're left guessing.

The machines that process fibers into thread were designed for cotton, which has a much shorter staple. Long linen fibers wouldn't play well with the machines, so industrially produced linen tends to be bred for shorter fibers and therefore can't be spun and woven into as fine a fabric as it could if the fibers were longer.

Large brands can create a so-called eco collection, tag it with feel-good messaging, and send it down the same industrial pipeline as the rest of their products. There is often little research, minimal fabric innovation, and no real commitment beyond what is trending. This is greenwashing in action. It earns them points for optics while still generating the same level of waste. They overproduce, cut prices, fail to sell it all, and eventually send those unsold goods to the dump. All the while, they continue to rely on plastic-derived textiles, petroleum-based dyes, and synthetic packaging.\n\nThe truly sustainable efforts are happening elsewhere. They begin not at the marketing phase but in the foundations of the supply chain. They explore textile innovation like natural solvent cotton recycling or next-generation alternatives such as plant-based fiber technologies. They design garments to last, not just to sell. That means using construction methods like flatlock seams, twin-needle stitching, tack reinforcements, and saddle-stitched hems that allow clothing to hold its shape and integrity for far longer.\n\nReal sustainable brands are not trying to sell you endless new products. They want you to buy less. They want their garments to last so long that second-hand becomes second nature. Thrifting, mending, reusing ‚Äî these are all essential pieces of the puzzle. True sustainability isn‚Äôt afraid of the second-hand market. In fact, it welcomes it. The goal is not just to offer better clothes but to reshape the mindset around ownership and consumption itself. Many of these smaller, values-driven brands are doing the best they can within limited means. Unfortunately, minimum order quantities and industrial sourcing models favor the large players; The same ones that have little incentive to slow down or change.\n\nBetter engineering leads to longer garment life. Longer life reduces the need to constantly replace. That, in turn, reduces demand on raw resources and waste output. The numbers are staggering. Over ninety million tons of textile waste are produced by the fashion industry every year. That‚Äôs the equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothing being dumped every single second.\n\nIf we want to change that, we have to go beyond recycled labels and into reshaping how and why clothing is made in the first place.

It‚Äôs easy to see how it‚Äôs pretty much an exercise in jumping on the bandwagon to look cool.

This is precisely why those who are fashionable end up not knowing anything about actual true sustainability.
