Spamming this megathread with your referral code will result in a ban! Deleting and reposting your referral code (unless it has an expiration date) will cause your comment to be removed.\n* Some popular/common codes (such as Rakuten, Rothy's, and Stitchfix) have special comment sections. If you're sharing or requesting one of those codes, please post that as a reply to the appropriate comment or it will be removed.\n* Codes and requests that are not directly related to female fashion may be removed.\n* Please reply if you have used a code to save others time :)\n* Please do not ask others to DM you for a code. If a user is asking you to DM them for a code or sign up for something in exchange for a code, please report this to the moderators. One purpose of the megathread is to keep everyone as safe as possible so that you are not exchanging personal information.\n* Be aware that providing a referral link or using someone else's link may reveal your personal information. For example, someone who clicks your referral link might see your full name, or a site may show your email address to the person who referred you.

I'm not interested in going to work or a bar in stained sweatpants and a ragged shirt that's 3 sizes too small. If anything work is a blessing as they gave me a bunch of shirts. And I just need to provide bottoms of some sort.\n\n\nI hate most everything I wear. Incidentally, I own almost no basics or classics that fit. I would need to go emergency shopping if I got invited to anything more formal than a farmer's market. Ready to just live in all black because otherwise I can buy lots of things and them have nothing match. I WANT true basics - as plain as possible, no designs or gimmicks. Cheap, long, and in plus sizes. And fast.

There are a lot of common styles associated with the expensive and polished look, but if you simply don‚Äôt enjoy those items or it doesn‚Äôt suit you, it still will not have your desired effect. For example, expensive-looking clothes tends to lean more neutral (white, black, beige, greys) and have simple/straight designs, but if the colors make your skin dull, it still will not be flattering. The clothes you wear should fit your body well. For this you don‚Äôt even need to buy new clothes. You can see how different cuts of clothing you already own flatter you in different ways. Pay attention to how materials lay on your body and how loose/tight fitting materials look. To avoid having to spend too much, I‚Äôve even mixed around pieces and used items in unconventional ways for different outfits like layering a skirt on top of a dress to make it look like the top half of the dress is a top.\n\nHaving said that, mock-neck tops, straight-cut slacks, long skirts/dresses made of thicker material (so it doesn‚Äôt crease as much and look cheap) tend to make outfits have a more elegant/professional look to them. Look into investing in a nice pair of boots or shoes that could work in multiple occasions as nice shoes can really help elevate even a more casual outfit. Pair clothes according to how well the materials/color tones match up with each other, so the outfits look more cohesive overall. For example, if you have a wool skirt, you‚Äôd want other parts of your outfit to be made of thicker materials (think leather boots and a knitted top vs a linen/silk top). Generally when it comes to jewelry and accessories, I would suggest thinner pieces without too much going on like a simple bracelet, small necklace, studs or medium-sized hoops.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1747796963, "created_iso": "2025-05-21T03:09:23+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "msxtzw9", "link_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "parent_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "author": null, "body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1747568362, "created_iso": "2025-05-18T11:39:22+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "mt0vo15", "link_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "parent_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "author": "socratessue", "body": "Best advice is black makes you feel put together", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1747605372, "created_iso": "2025-05-18T21:56:12+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "mt1u4f2", "link_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "parent_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "author": null, "body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1747617950, "created_iso": "2025-05-19T01:25:50+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "mt5qgj1", "link_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "parent_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "author": "GnGPanda", "body": "My go-to is black jeans or slacks, a blouse, sometimes partially tucked if it's cut nicely for that, black flats, and minimal jewelry.

They‚Äôre also worn and washed so you know the quality of the item you‚Äôre getting, so it gives some peace of mind.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1747878025, "created_iso": "2025-05-22T01:40:25+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "msxgr0p", "link_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "parent_id": "t1_msx6bm9", "author": null, "body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1747560729, "created_iso": "2025-05-18T09:32:09+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "msxk1aj", "link_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "parent_id": "t1_msx6bm9", "author": "HealthMeRhonda", "body": "No problem. I listened to all of the natural material advice in the beginning and my wardrobe ended up being such a pain in the ass to take care of. I live in a tiny space so there is literally nowhere to flat dry anything.\n\n\n\n\nFor minimalist makeup all I do is the lash and brow tint with some tinted moisturiser.¬†\n\n\n\n\nHair loss I understand as well because I've dealt with hypothyroidism and B12 deficiency. Luckily mine turned out to be reversible but it's always been on the thinner side and for a while I thought I had inherited male pattern baldness and was using minoxidil and even bought a wig. Let me know if you want more detail about either of those.¬†\n\n\n\n\nI found it helpful to look at hot people with thinner and finer hair textures. For example Bella Hadid, Ariana grande, Hailey Bieber (sorry for the lack of diversity those are just examples I remember from hair loss subreddits). I'm sure you would be able to find people with similar hair as yours who you can use as inspo, just remember celebrities wear hair pieces a lot.¬†\n\n\n\n\nOnce I've settled on an achievable hairstyle for my thickness I sometimes use a little bit of colored root spray to help give the illusion of a thicker parting or hairline. Zoe Cavey has a YouTube video in her hair loss playlist explaining how to apply it so that it looks more natural, it's called \"Thin to thick hair transformation\".\n\n\n\n\nIt makes a big difference having an experienced hairstylist who can give you a cut that helps to work with what you've got. I've also got wavy hair so I have a curl routine. If you have some texture that you can describe a little bit I might be able to point you to a relevant content creator.¬†", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1747562789, "created_iso": "2025-05-18T10:06:29+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "mt9cygq", "link_id": "t3_1kp5kjf", "parent_id": "t1_mt9cyf3", "author": "AutoModerator", "body": "Your [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/1kp5kjf/how_to_look_more_expensive_on_a_budget/mt9cyf3/?context=3) in /r/FrugalFemaleFashion was removed for breaking Rule 6 of our subreddit:\n\n**No Astroturfing/Self-Promotion**\n\nUsing Frugal Female Fashion to promote your own company, feign user interest, or try and sell personal items will result in removal and a permanent ban.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Their marketing also emphasizes ‚Äúluxury quality‚Äù, so I expected at least a basic level of craftsmanship ‚Äî but instead, I ran into a lot of issues, from bad sizing advice before purchase and major sizing inconsistencies to poor craftsmanship.\n\nIf I went into all the painful back-and-forth with customer service over quality issues and inconsistency across their boots, I‚Äôd be writing a book.\n\nIn short, I ended up with a pair that had such a huge discrepancy between the soles that I had to take them to a cobbler to manually cut and shave down the sticking-out sole just to make them look remotely even (see before photo). On top of that, the black leather bleeds badly. A gentle wipe with a damp cotton cloth caused a lot of black/bluish ink to come off ‚Äî which could easily ruin light-colored pants. To even make these boots wearable, I had to buy leather protectant/sealant and pay the cobbler for additional work.\n\nFor a brand that claims their boots are handmade and worth what they list as the full price, this level of craftsmanship is unacceptable. Natural leather imperfections are expected ‚Äî but mistakes made during assembly like mismatched soles and leather treatment are not.\n\nMeanwhile, the same ‚Äú75% off‚Äù sale has been running non-stop for months for all women‚Äôs boots and they keep restocking them, so it‚Äôs not a real clearance or a genuine final sale.\nYou can check out their full selection of women‚Äôs boots here: https://www.koio.co/collections/boots-womens\n\nIf buying from anywhere outside the US beware that even for regular priced items, they don‚Äôt refund shipping or import duties, and also charge restocking fees + return shipping, making returns extremely expensive and hardly worth it. \n\nHonestly, trying to support a smaller and supposedly more ethical brand ended up being my worst purchasing experience ever. At least with mass production brands you pay less, know what you‚Äôre getting, and don‚Äôt end up with a big headache over returns and exchanges.\n\nJust wanted to post this as a heads-up in case anyone else was thinking of buying during one of their shady ‚Äúlimited‚Äô sales. There are much better options when it comes to both quality and customer service. \n", "author": "LladySeven", "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 5, "link_flair_text": "Brand Review", "over_18": false, "is_self": false, "removed_by": null, "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "stickied": false, "awards": [], "comments": [{"id": "mp92tqm", "link_id": "t3_1k8ppe8", "parent_id": "t3_1k8ppe8", "author": "lutapipoo", "body": "We bought Hoka from Backcountry.com & that turned to be  a fake confirmed with Hoka with.a letter from them  & now fighting with Backcountry .. gotto be extra vigilant", "score": 19, "created_utc": 1745721629, "created_iso": "2025-04-27T02:40:29+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "mpidcj7", "link_id": "t3_1k8ppe8", "parent_id": "t3_1k8ppe8", "author": "lutapipoo", "body": "We pay the same for fakes !

{"id": "1i9tr7l", "subreddit": "FrugalFemaleFashion", "created_utc": 1737830541, "created_iso": "2025-01-25T18:42:21+00:00", "title": "Amour Vert shipping and dress sizing reviews", "selftext": "Hi since we all bought so much stuff from the Amour Vert sale - thanks so much to the original OP who posted.\n\nI placed 3 orders.  One on the 15th, which arrived on the 24th. Another on the 16th which is slated to arrive on the 28th and one on the 17th which has a status of ready to ship. The first two orders were when the sale was $20. The third order was when things were $10.\n\nMy first order, which I received is mostly dresses in size M. I am petite pear shaped. Normally I wear a 4-6 on tops and 6-8 on bottoms. Generally I take an S in most dresses (especially if A-line) but will take an M in body con styles. I bought all M dresses in Amour Vert since previously I purchase 3 silk dresses in either shift or A-line shape and 2 out of 3 of them did not fit my hips at all- they felt like a size 4 or small 6 on the hips.\n\nI purchased the crochet dress, joyce, danielle, square neck dresses in size M. I like them in that order. I can see myself wearing the crochet and joyce dresses a lot. They fit my hips nicely. The danielle dress feels overall large and I think I look frumpy upon first trying it. there is a massive improvement if I roll up the sleeves. The fabric is very nice. There is a possibility I could have taken an S in this style. The Square neck dress is the biggest disappointment, the shoulders are too big to me but I do have very small shoulders, and the sleeves are also clownish and frumpy on my petite frame like the Danielle. This one I can't fix easily by only rolling up sleeves (that also improves the look tremendously), it will require that I sew or use safety pins so that the dress stays on my shoulders. I might do that since it fits nicely in all the other dimensions and is a nice fabric. But if anyone was disappointed in not being able to get this style, and wants to purchase these square neck dresses from me in a size M, DM me. I have it in two colors, the soleil yellow (like saffron) and elm (taupey brownish). I can list it on Depop or whatever, just let me know.\n\nI also bought the Agolde Harper jeans in size 31. It is easily one or two sizes too big on me. If anyone wants to do a trade if they have 29, that would be great. It says relaxed fit but I think it runs true to size since my normal jeans size is 29 and I think that size would fit me best given how the 31 fits.\n\nI also bought some cashmere hats. They don't feel substantial, are very thin and not very long. For the sale price fine, but I don't think they are worth the original $100 retail. I don't know how to describe the style, they called it a beanie, but it fits so much tighter and shorter than my other beanies from other brands. I don't have a small head, but I don't think it's large either. It definitely feels like they styled it to skimp on material.\n\nMy next order to arrive will mostly be tops in size S. Hoping they will fit.\n\nI hope these reviews help someone.

The environmental focused fashion subreddits¬† wouldn't want to hear and neither would the more mainstream fashion subreddits.¬†\n\n\nMosaic Brands had started or bought up a lot of brands and it wasn't uncommon for a reasonable sized shopping centre to have three or four shops each selling one of their different brands.

Because just about everyone used one of their brands even with the shitty delivery times. And so many people work for them.\n\n\nAnd I can't even feel glad a fast fashion company is gone.

I noticed the quality of the jewelry would always be a gamble. Some of my bracelets, an evil-eye one and a beaded one, were bafflingly bad quality - like, horrendous.\n\nMy friend got into AliExpress, so I checked it out. There's an image search; you copy an image of an item, and then go on AliExpress, click the camera icon in the search bar, and paste the image into the image-search box. (CTRL-C the image from EvryJewels, then CTRL-V it into the image search on AliExpress.) \n\nBoom. Almost. Every. Single. Jewelry Item. from EvryJewels that I searched for using the image search function on AliExpress came up. \n\nI can't post links to AliExpress or Alibaba here, but here are two necklaces from EvryJewels that came up as IDENTICAL.\n\n[https://evryjewels.com/products/meribella-necklace](https://evryjewels.com/products/meribella-necklace)\n\n[https://evryjewels.com/products/aura-necklace](https://evryjewels.com/products/aura-necklace)\n\nAgain, I am NOT trying to promote AliExpress; I am trying to warn people of buying from EvryJewels, especially when it's full price or even the \"BOGO\" - since you may be paying over 1500% more than you need to pay and while under the belief you're getting boutique, in-house made jewelry that is high quality.\n\nSome of their jewelry doesn't come up  but is almost identical - or isn't \"unique\" enough in look to be differentiated from many other items by the search. But note that it is sometimes *completely identical*, like the image and the models wearing the jewelry. \n\nNote that Alibaba isn't the only wholesale provider, and a lot of other ones don't have image search functions (Alibaba itself has the search function) - so the fact that some of their jewelry doesn't come up on AliExpress is not in itself proof it was created \"in house\" or not bought from a wholesale then marked up by thousands in percentage. \n\nLike almost two months ago, I left a review about this on one of their brick and mortar stores (using a different email that I was logged into) and the response I got was: \n\n>We're surprised and disappointed to hear your feedback. **We design and create all of our jewelry in-house.** We take pride in our designs and the quality of our products.\n\n>We couldn't find an order associated with your name in our system. If you could provide more details about your order, such as the order number or the date of purchase, we can investigate further.\n\n>We encourage you to reach out to our customer service team at [support@evryjewels.com](mailto:support@evryjewels.com) to discuss your concerns in more detail. We're committed to resolving any issues and ensuring customer\n\nSo, I emailed customer service with the subject line \"Ordered Items Found on AliExpress,\" (and asking for a refund) and got a response within ONE MINUTE, saying:\n\n>I understand your concerns about finding similar items on AliExpress, and I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. **At Evry Jewels, we collaborate with various designers and manufacturers to offer unique pieces, and we take pride in our designs and quality. However, it‚Äôs not uncommon for similar designs to appear on other platforms.**\n\n>Regarding your request for a refund, I want to remind you that all sales are final, as stated in our refund policy. We are unable to accommodate changes, returns, exchanges, or cancellations after an order is placed.\n\n>I believe a specialist will be better equipped to assist you with this next step. I‚Äôll transfer your case to them now. You can expect a response within the next 24 to 36 hours. Just a quick note: Each time you email us before we‚Äôve had a chance to respond, your ticket gets pushed back in the queue as we answer inquiries from oldest to newest.\n\n>Should you need any further assistance, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.\n\nAliExpress gets their items from Alibaba. Why would wholesale Chinese warehouses recreate some of EvryJewels's items in an *exact, identical* fashion and, based on what I ordered from AliExpress to compare, with the same quality? \n\n\"At EvryJewels, we collaborate with various designers and manufacturers to offer unique pieces, and we take pride in our designs and quality. However, it‚Äôs not uncommon for similar designs to appear on other platforms.\"\n\nSo... by \"collaborate,\" they mean just order wholesale and brand it as their own, and up-charge the jewelry by sometimes almost *2500%*? (Possibly more at times; but proven almost 2500%.)\n\nProof of one case of almost 2500% up-charge:\n\n*Identical* necklace to \"Meribella Necklace\" sold on Alibaba for **$3.00-5.00** wholesale. (Image search on Alibaba.)\n\nMeribella Necklace sold on EvryJewels for **$76** (regular price): [https://evryjewels.com/products/meribella-necklace](https://evryjewels.com/products/meribella-necklace)\n\nIf bought at $3 each wholesale, that's a 2433.33% up-charge. Also note **Alibaba uses the exact same images, including model images, that EvryJewel includes in their images for this necklace.**\n\nGo look at the Alibaba wholesale seller's page for all of its women's jewelry. Look familiar?! \n\nAgain, I am NOT promoting this wholesale seller; **I am trying to warn people of these \"affordable\" \"waterproof and tarnish-free\" jewelry \"boutiques\" that are all the rage.** I was essentially duped, and now I am pissed and don't want others to be duped as well. \n\nI don't know what \"specialist\" my email to EvryJewel's customer support was just sent to, or why my email was replied to in literally (I am not exaggerating) a singular minute; a bit sketchy.", "author": "rheannahh", "score": 328, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 38, "link_flair_text": "Brand Review", "over_18": false, "is_self": true, "removed_by": null, "edited": true, "distinguished": null, "stickied": false, "awards": [], "comments": [{"id": "m556e63", "link_id": "t3_1hs48ug", "parent_id": "t3_1hs48ug", "author": "AutoModerator", "body": "Thanks for your submission, /u/rheannahh!\n\n* As a reminder, please make sure your submission meets [r/FrugalFemaleFashion rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/about/rules) or it may be removed.\n\n* If you're posting a sale, please include a link to the deal.\n\n* One-time use or referral cash/codes/coupons and item requests should be posted in the [monthly megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/ie6sus/megathread_index_find_links_to_the/).\n\n* We may let you know if your post would fit better in our weekly discussion threads: Testimonial Tuesday, Whiny Wednesday, Free Talk Friday, and (No) Stupid Question Sunday.\n\n* If your post seems to be stuck or removed and you have questions, feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/FrugalFemaleFashion)!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I ran a clothing brand, which is why I know how the manufacturing process works, but I closed up shop because I started to feel guilty about contributing to clothing production. On the rare occasion when I need something new and factory-produced, I buy from overstock/off-price retailers. Thrifting is an affordable option (I like ThredUp), but the truth is that the only consistently frugal thing to do is stop buying as much as possible.\n\nTo your other points, sinophobia does play a role in American consumers's minds. That being said, Shein, Temu, and Amazon get the most heat because they're so naked about it. Most American consumers do not research what they're buying but they can clock that a 1 dollar t-shirt with a poorly translated copy is suspect. Disguising an unethical supply chain the way Zara or H&M does is an exercise in branding. That being said, we shouldn't pretend all brands are equally unethical. Shein, Temu, and Amazon steal design concepts, model photos, copy, etc.\n\nTo compare, Nike at least hires models, photographers, designers, pattern drafters, graphic designers, copywriters, etc. The point of bottom-of-the-barrel stuff like dropshipping is to avoid paying as many people as possible to get a product to market.

I was hesitant at first b/c the sticker prices were more than I wanted to spend, but as I started shopping the online site more, I saw how often they offer deals- it seems like at least once a month they have an offer like 50% off + an additional 20% off if you order $125+. I wait for those offers, and then stock up. Even at 50% off, it can be a little high- but waiting for those extra deals really makes a difference. Their rewards program can also add a nice bonus if you shop there more frequently. I feel the sizing is really consistent, and the fits are flattering (5‚Äô4‚Äù, size 10). To me, the quality is definitely higher than Target and it reads higher-end than Target, so there‚Äôs definitely some value there. Shoes aren‚Äôt amazing and run narrow.

If you want to bring something new into your wardrobe, you need to get rid of a similar piece. Eg. buy a blouse, donate a blouse. New pair of jeans, old pair of jeans. This works better after you purge your wardrobe of the stuff you never wear, because if you replace something you always wear, it had better work for you. \n* Never buy something the first time you see it, even if it feels like an immediate yes, or even if it's a great price. Add that thing to your wish list and evaluate whether the other pieces on your wishlist are more pressing than the thing you just found. \n* I use a wardrobe app and actually track each time I wear something in my wardrobe (have been doing this since 2020). My goal for every item I purchase is to wear it at least 30 times before I retire it. If you wear it once per week, it will take you 7.5 months to get to 30 wears. Can you picture yourself actually wearing the item that often? For some context, my jeans (most worn bottoms) have wears in the 100s. My dresses (even casual ones) start to feel \"old\" to me after around 7 wears. So I try to be very selective about dresses, because I don't actually like to repeat them often, even when I love the dress and it feels nice on.\n* If something needs a small alteration, I have to go within the return window (and have the tags still on). If the tailor says it will be too complicated or if it seems too expensive, I return it, even if I really like it. \n* I stick to a general color palette.

It also helps to follow sustainable ones, and not those who are always going on or posting that sale item, or cheap pieces and large hauls- this can often act as a trigger. Notice the recommendations and if they fit you and your style and follow the select few again.\n2.\t‚Å†Unsubscribe from the shopping emails! This is such a trigger; every email is an invitation to open and see what's out there and fall into the vicious cycle.\n3.\t‚Å†Fashion culture thrives and revolves around people spending money. I like to think about how my hard-earned money is being thrown into   spending on cheap quality and feeding these companies to make more profits, more clothes, and honestly cheating us out of good quality and sustainable products.\n4.\t‚Å†For the clothes you might already own and never worn, I like to specifically look up the item and how it was styled on the manufacturer's site; you can also go broader with styling tips once you are familiar with the piece.\n5.\t‚Å†I personally don't support the \"one in, one out\" wardrobe management. Not only can you end up discarding a perfectly good clothing you might be wearing already, but now you're contributing to the tonnes of landfill from the clothing industry. If you already have a black blouse, and you end up wanting to buy another, you can keep both if they're different styles and style them interchangeably and get good wear from both.\n6.\t‚Å†Choosing to invest in more natural, quality fibers than polyester. Good-quality poly exists and might work for some cases but that's an exception than both. This rule is especially great for filtering out  sweaters to ensure you're getting good quality and durability. IMO, acrylic, poly and other materials end up making for itchy sweaters, not keeping shape, or shrinking and pilling after few uses. This largely limits how many things you cannot buy.\n7.\t‚Å†Don't keep it unless you LOVE it. It can take a few trials and sleeping on it for few days or a week and trying it again to get a feel for it.\n8.\t‚Å†Keep those never-worns right in front of you, and make it a point to pick it up next time you're dressing up. If you hesitate about wearing it, look into why and how you can remedy that. Eat it's something that doesn't fit anymore, you can donate or sell; if it's something needing alteration, prioritize that; If it's an accessory you're missing, buy that than another item of clothing.\n9.\t‚Å†Only buy products you can return or you end up  just building a shop in the closet üòÖ.\n10.\t‚Å†Be ruthless and honest to yourself about what you know you won't/cannot wear and give it away. I heard this recently in a yt video about removing items from your closet is beneficial- not the exact words but there's an unknown stress of that item just waiting to be worn and each time you see it or   don't pick up, there's a little bit of guilt about having spent on it and not wearing it. Her recent closet clean out vids are great btw if that's some inspo you were looking for.\n11.\t‚Å†Finally, making a shopping list of things you want to buy and even linking the item helps so much with the impulse shopping. I just keep one on my phone and just leave it in there and go for a month. Sometimes I come back and delete some and don't even remember why I wanted it so much that it got on the list. Wait as long as you can to see if you still want it or it was just a case of 'excessive exposure' to the item.\n\nThis has to be one of my longest posts ever ü§£I hope it's given you a few ideas.

I can't put my finger on one exact thing I don't like about it but here's a few things:\n\n1. I don't think everyone will agree but I think fast fashion has become an overused term. Sometimes on this sub (and many other places) it seems like more of a short hand for \"clothes people can easily find, afford, have the opportunity to try on before they buy, and easily return if they don't like them.\" There's obviously a snobbishness about dismissing basically everything anyone could buy and wear that day as \"fast fashion\". Now, I think there's a real problem and some brands really do make junk that won't hold up to a few wears just for people who want to look a certain way for a season (or less), but if we're being honest some brands/items dismissed as \"fast fashion\" will last as long as the wearer wants to wear them (assuming they don't work on a construction site or something) and probably much longer. I get that that's still a problem since they could wind up in a landfill and never be worn, but I'm not sure a clothing economy that relies on people buying good quality high end clothes and discarding them while they're still in good shape is sustainable and necessarily ethical either. I feel like the sustainability angle is kind of a cheap shot. If you care about fashion you're probably buying more clothes than you need to achieve a certain look, maybe it's somehow more ethical if they're high end but that can't always be said for certain either (do you really know the entire supply chain? etc.).\n2. I've always been attracted to higher end clothing and wanted to learn more about it, and with online shopping/secondhand selling it has become easier than ever to shop for it. Also I now finally am at a point in my life where I have the means to buy some of it. I have to admit, my experiences have not been as good as yours buying either new high end clothing on sale or used high end clothing at a decent price. In my experience, almost all high end used clothes I find on the usual sites are priced at or near the full/maximum value of the item given its condition and used status. I'm talking usually something like $10-50 off MSRP (depending on the item), I can often find the what the item sold for when it was more widely available on sale and see that it was sold cheaper new. Personally I think an item being used should take a bigger hit, especially if there's visible signs of wear. I also find sellers are usually rather unwilling to negotiate, generally unhelpful and rude, and I've been disappointed by the described condition of more than a couple of items. Sometimes the high end item wasn't that great in the first place and there are diminishing returns (is a 150 dollar t-shirt really always 10 times better than a 15 dollar one?). There are exceptions, but the good exception seems more common than the mediocre/bad experience that is the rule. Maybe I'm picky or a bad buyer, but almost everyone I have shared my experiences with or showed an item (and its accompanying online description) has agreed (and many share their own horror stories with online clothes or that this is why they'd never consider it). Also just as a general thing clothes ultimately go on your body for hours and people understandably want relatively clean ones in decent shape, there's no shame in wanting something new that will wear to your body, absorb your sweat and oils, etc.\n3. I also think it has to be said that people are good at rationalizing when they probably spent too much money on something. That's okay, and it probably ultimately was worth the money if you genuinely feel that way but that doesn't mean everyone else would feel that way if they spent the same amount. I see your attempt to make the prices equal but let's be honest, it will almost certainly cost more money to achieve the same wardrobe if one only buys high end (even if used) clothing, and it will take considerably more time and probably more stress dealing with sellers and so on. It's also okay for other people to be happy with something they could find at a price they felt comfortable with, could try on in a store, and were ultimately happy with. There's room for both, and if high end stuff gets more in demand the prices will only go up more if used.\n\nI don't mean this as an attack because I think you're not entirely wrong but something about the general attitude of \"everyone should only buy secondhand clothing or they're tasteless people who hate the environment because the prices are totally equal\" seems a little dishonest or like you're trying to feel superior to others.", "score": 97, "created_utc": 1723780711, "created_iso": "2024-08-16T03:58:31+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lid13nh", "link_id": "t3_1et9tch", "parent_id": "t3_1et9tch", "author": "SlowerThanTurtleInPB", "body": "I dislike shopping.

Best seasons to buy are July/August and Jan/Feb. This is when retailers including consignment shops offer additional off clearance. Finally go to your local department store and try on shoes or clothes that are full price to determine sizing for brands you want to invest in. I recommend writing it down so you have those sizes for shopping online consignment.

I think Depop has a younger demographic so it‚Äôs probably better if you‚Äôre looking for trendier clothes or want to search by ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô. Mercari often has the best prices because they don‚Äôt charge seller fees, but it isn‚Äôt optimized for clothes in the way that Poshmark is. I default to Poshmark and start checking Mercari/Depop if I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôve found good enough options/prices on Poshmark. \n\nAlso, hot tip - sorting by lowest price on any app gets you a lot of weird/shitty options, and sorting by new can make it harder to find good prices. You can add more filter terms to weed out the weird stuff when you sort low-high, but then you cut out items from my favorite demographic of resellers: lazy rich people who are selling stuff super casually just to see if they can get out of a trip to goodwill and don‚Äôt bother to take many pictures or add color descriptors or anything. SO, in my opinion, the best move for truly good prices is to use as few search terms/filters as you can get away with (ie., use filters only for size range, and use minimal words in your search: small/medium/6/8/10 as filters, and ‚Äòmaxmara skirt‚Äô as the search) and then set an additional filter for a max price 20% above what you‚Äôre willing to pay and a minimum price that cuts out the most poorly tagged cheap shit or store bags or whatever (usually like $10-$20, depending on the item). Then let it sort by ‚Äònew‚Äô or ‚Äòrelevant‚Äô. I don‚Äôt start adding additional filters for color, dress length, etc. unless the broader search isn‚Äôt working. If you‚Äôre looking for a specific fabric rather than a brand, add the term ‚Äò100%‚Äô to your search (ie. 100% silk) or else you‚Äôre going to get a ton of results that say ‚Äòfeels like silk!‚Äô or ‚Äòsilk/poly blend‚Äô in the description.", "score": 103, "created_utc": 1723816759, "created_iso": "2024-08-16T13:59:19+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "lihbb3g", "link_id": "t3_1et9tch", "parent_id": "t1_liekmc0", "author": null, "body": "I just want to add Vestiaire Collective to the websites OP has listed.

I am a huge anthro shopper, most of my clothes come from there. For that reason I find myself in store fairly often making returns of online purchases. And I usually try a few things on while I‚Äôm there. Typically even if I really like something I leave w out it & keep an eye for it to go on sale online. So in this instance I could also check for it second hand. The thing is that all the stars would have to line up just so - THE item I‚Äôm looking for, in THE color I‚Äôm looking for, in THE size I‚Äôm looking for - and therein lies why I just don‚Äôt bother pursuing second hand shopping.\n\nBut it‚Äôs still good to know, just kind of a good reminder that those stores/platforms are out there & I should really take a look from time to time. At the very least for purses/accessories. Which could serve as a good entree into using these sources more just by getting acquainted w the search mechanisms & such. \n\nI do already do a superficial skim for second hand Theory pieces that I‚Äôve tried on in-store from time to time. I have fit & fabric luck w this brand but you know $$$ üò≥ Haven‚Äôt had success yet but you make me more motivated to keep trying. Eileen Fisher can be good for linen & basics too, but I find the collection swings wildly from year to year in style between matronly & simple, age versatile basics. Like the brand is in perpetual identity crisis. Sometimes the color palette is atrocious. But some years there‚Äôs loads to like. And EF really does have good practices ethically speaking, last I knew anyway so that‚Äôs nice. \n\nFor athletic wear I stick to cheap dupes on amazon. I workout 7 days a week, sometimes twice a day so my need in this department is for volume. I need lots of pairs of leggings & sports tanks. And I love my dupes, I‚Äôm completely satisfied on quality, fit, performance, durability. Too, If I were to guess lululemon is hardly more ethical than the next in its practices‚Äîbut I‚Äôve not looked into it, I very well may be wrong. And if I am wrong, we all gotta pick our battles & I‚Äôm sticking w my cheap dupes on this one. \n\nI have friends of greatly varying weights/sizes that will never understand how lucky they are to be well or average proportioned. This makes shopping loads easier, and much more actual fun & enjoyable. My absurdly high hips, large rib cage, small shoulders neck & head, small cup size, absurdly long arms, longish torso/shortish legs gives me a lot to contend w when it comes to dressing. My size measurements B/W/H translate to either 4-10-6 or 6-12-8 in US sizing depending on my weight. Having your waist be your biggest size at three sizes larger than your bust & two larger than your hips is a major PITA. In S/M/L sizing I can fall anywhere between xs-L depending on the garment. When clothes shopping you buy to fit your largest part‚Äîthis means in pants, typically you buy to fit your hips & have the waist taken in. For me it‚Äôs the reverse, I have to buy for the large waist & then basically have the whole rest of pant reconstructed so a $10-$40 pant could cost hundred(s) after tailoring. And there‚Äôs no guarantee it will flatter or wear well in the end. So it‚Äôs much better for me to try on a gazillion pair of pants to find ones that miraculously fit well enough off the rack & might be amenable to waist stretching (like Levi‚Äôs for example) and then buy on sale. In dresses I often have to have the waist shortened, side zippers removed, pockets removed, shoulders adjusted, sleeves narrowed, etc. And this is after finding the needle in the haystack of tops/dresses that are max 3/4 length sleeves because long sleeves will always be too short. Pants/jumpsuits with an extremely high rise. No bias cuts, no t-shirt or cocoon cuts, no shoulder pads, no puffy shoulders or sleeves, no second skin tight bodycon, no pleats w the exception of paper bag, avoid side pockets, no top lengths other than crop or tunic (or work tucked in), no stretchy jeans, no smocking at waist, no chiffon, no common cut sweaters, no common blazers, no bombers, no quilts, I could go on until I‚Äôm blue on the face. And of course, it has to be age appropriate. I can‚Äôt just wear a-line/pencil/slim style mini dresses anymore which was my uniform when younger. And it‚Äôs gotta work w my existing wardrobe. \n\nLord knows you did not want or need to know all of that ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, your life was better before even knowing about the existence of that wall of text üòÇ Once I started I couldn‚Äôt stop, I apologize for that.

They combine shipping if you buy at the same time, eBay and all the other e commerce sites have high quality clothing for as little as $1-3. Charity thrift stores actually get too much clothes and send it to landfills in third world countries, the issues people bring up about the privilege of knowing what to look for isn‚Äôt limited to people with money and resellers. Poor people often learn about quality as they observe what‚Äôs inaccessible, and by the way, poor people with a good eye are also resellers‚Äî my family was poor and I started selling vintage second hand on eBay when I was in high school. Vintage and high end pieces would just sit there unsold and go on super clearance, and this is actually still common with lesser known high end designers. In the last couple of years I have found designers like Alexander Wang, Vince, and Blumarine on super clearance because they‚Äôre overlooked. I enjoy thrifting and the hunt, a lot of thrifters are doing it for practical and financial reasons, they are still finding solid higher quality clothing than they‚Äôd otherwise be able to afford.\n\nThe same effort people put into looking at reviews on Amazon, Shein, Reddit, can be utilized to shop second hand. Many of the barriers mentioned are artificial. It‚Äôs one thing to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in buying  second hand‚Äù but it‚Äôs another to create a false narrative about it being broadly inaccessible. \n\nSize issues definitely can present an obstacle because finding fashionable, comfortable, well fitting clothing that matches your particular style is already a struggle for anyone who is particularly tall or short, plus sized (especially at the larger end) or extremely small (people are confusing XS which is still a standard size, with XXXS or 00 and under). And the angst of shopping when the majority of clothes are designed to fit straight sizes /average fits is further complicated by body image issues and the emotional impact of living in a body society doesn‚Äôt really care to accommodate. But people who have identified brands and styles that fit their bodies definitely can and do benefit from the online used clothing marketplace, which actually broadens their options. It can be as easy as shopping brands you already know and trust, or if you want to invest the time and effort, learning about brands that accommodate your body type, going to their stores or ordering from them online (checking return policies) to check fit, and then seeking out those brands and styles second hand‚Äî not everyone wants to do this, but a lot of people who like fashion but don‚Äôt fall into XS-XL sizing do this in order to be able to wear better versions of what‚Äôs in their budget.

In the last couple of years I have found designers like Alexander Wang, Vince, and Blumarine on super clearance because they‚Äôre overlooked.\"\n\nI think this is a very different thrift environment than what I'm talking about...no thrift store here has \"clearance\", I'm just talking about your average thrift shop.\n\nI'm not really talking about people who thrift shop anyway and if they happen to find a very high-value item buy it to resell - that's a little different than people who's whole job/employment is to go and strip thrift stores of basically any higher-value or good brand they can find.  I doubt the majority of sellers online are doing that either, but definitely in the luxury market it's more true.  I don't truly blame people for doing that, but at the same time, a lot of thrift stops have started following what's selling high and sorting + pricing by brand because of that - if someone is making money off that, they want it to be them.\n\nIt's more the mass buying - like we used to have a 5$/bag days here, and they were fantastic for the community.  They don't do that anymore, but back close to when they stopped, I saw someone come in with carts and literally take every pair of shoes not falling apart to resell.  There are a lot of people in my community who relied on yearly-biyearly sale days to fill their wardrobes again, and it's not against the \\*rules\\* to do that, but still ends up basically breaking the system.\n\nAnd lastly - this is part of affordability in terms of shipping costs, but also global planet change - unfortunately internet shopping is still contributing to greenhouse gasses and it's much less efficient for people to buy one or even several pieces individually and have that shipped to them than it is for a thrift store to get bales of clothing sent together and sell it locally.\n\nre sizing - even in brands I'm somewhat familiar with in terms of fit, their sizing and fit and styles change over time, and that makes it difficult even then. If 50% of what I buy ends up not fitting me and not being returnable because it was online, that's a big problem with affordability.\n\nI think some of this just comes down to your local thrifting market, though.

There's not a lot of reselling here. There's charity shops, Facebook marketplace, eBay, Gumtree and a few vintage resale shops. Facebook and Gumtree are notoriously full of scammers and meth addled psychos¬† and quite frankly I don't want the last thing anyone heard of me being that I was headed somewhere to buy a tshirt. The resale shops are very expensive. The charity shops have mostly trash and mostly overpriced. And I don't have an eBay account and do not intend to get one because receiving deliveries is rather difficult in my neighbourhood... there's a lot of passing foot traffic and anything left outside tends to disappear in a few minutes so for anything¬† that won't fit in a mail slot the post office instead leaves cards saying \"pick up from mail centre\" and the mail centre is two bus rides away.¬†\n\n\nBasically, getting something in the mail is going to cost me an entire morning or afternoon that could be spent in income producing activity, and two dollars in bus fares. I could ask they redirect stuff to a different post office or to post restante but that tends to fuck up. I have a friend with a post office box but it's a fair amount of faffing about and I don't want to inconvenience that friend regularly. I don't want to get my own post office box because they are a little spendy.¬†¬†\n\n\nSo my wardrobe gets to be 60 percent secondhand, 10 percent homemade and 30 percent new. And I'm okay with that.

Nothing wrong with that! üôÇ I remember that, when I was young, I always wanted to be \"fashion forward\" and wear the latest looks myself so I can relate. I had \"champagne taste on a water budget.\" \n\nSo here are some things I did. \n\nI had my colors done. There's a book called \"Color Me Beautiful\" by Carole Jackson. It helps you figure out the color palette that you look best in. Once you know this, you have the tools to build a wardrobe you will look and feel great wearing. \n\nNext is figure analysis.  This will help you choose the silhouettes most complimentary for your figure type. \n\nNow that you know what colors and silhouettes look best on you, it's time to build your wardrobe. Begin by doing what's now called a \"capsule wardrobe\" of basics you can mix and match. Begin with solid colors and then add colorful coordinating pieces. By mixing and matching, you will have a lot of *bang for the buck* looks.\n\nThese are your wardrobe basics. To limit spending, just purchase a few of the trendy items to accessorize or accent your basic wardrobe.  Just a trendy thing here-and-there will give an updated *refresh* to your wardrobe. \n\nYou might want to consider learning some crafting techniques so you can make yourself some unique jewelry, hair ornaments, scarves, and so on. Adding a little beading or hand embroidery to your clothing will add to your unique fashion looks. \n\nLearning to sew can help also. While making your own garments is not necessarily less expensive than purchasing items, if you have fitting issues, it can make a big difference in how a garment hangs and looks. \n\nEducate yourself on fabric care so your wardrobe always looks its best. Mend things when they need it. Be sure to launder items as recommended. Taking good care of items will make them last.\n\nI hope these ideas help.

A strong sense of individual style will make you alot more selective in your purchases. With trend chasing you'll constantly accumulate things that go out of fashion quickly. You might also want to take a measured step back from social media. If you're sensing some insecurity, and your constant purchases are relating to that (comparing yourself with others), unplugging a bit will help big time.\n\nOn the more practical side, give yourself a hard stance quota/rule. Such as you're only allowed to buy X number of items every month or 2. Or you will only spend approximately X amount of money on clothes per month or so. If you hit your limit, you stop. If you can remain disciplined in this way, you'll find it will slow down your spending habits, and you'll only take home the items you ABSOLUTELY love. Not just picking up things because it kind of looks cute, it's there, and the price is nice.\n\nActually, here's an old school budget control tip I learned for a family member: For 1 month or 2, set aside physical cash. If you're shopping in person, pay for it with that stash. Seeing the physical money go, will make you alot more mindful of what your spending as well as aware of how fast your burning through it.\n\nAnd about being okay with the clothes you do have, take some time and really go through your closet. For each item, ask yourself, \"Do I really love it? Do I really like this for myself? Or did I just buy it b/c it was trendy?\" Remember fashion is an expression of you personally. Sometimes trend chasing happens b/c we haven't experimented enough with our own sense of style.

The desirability of most fashion is dictated by designers, retailers or our peers ‚Äî hardly ever ourselves. This powers psychological obsolescence: When trends change, so does our satisfaction. The antidote, argues Jonathan Chapman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University‚Äôs School of Design, is emotional durability, a term he coined. Our possessions, particularly clothes, serve as extensions of identities, even our values. By recognizing what makes the items valuable, rather than merely desired, fashion can become timeless, whether it‚Äôs an heirloom engagement ring or a faded pair of jeans.\n\nI think suggestions like visible mending are great ways to give our existing items more meaning.", "score": 20, "created_utc": 1701613765, "created_iso": "2023-12-03T14:29:25+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "kbrro0f", "link_id": "t3_18985fv", "parent_id": "t1_kbpenf6", "author": "RambleOnRose42", "body": "Look into r/visiblemending!!
