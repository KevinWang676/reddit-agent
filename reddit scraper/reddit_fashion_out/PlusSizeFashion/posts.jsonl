In my opinion, the top’s construction is poor -it looks ill-fitting on the model, the silhouette feels overly busy, and peplums just read as outdated to me.

You're definitely winning.\n\nThat said, I too feel fairly certain it's not really golf course appropriate.\n\nYou might want to invest in golf shoes not to mention a collared shirt & definitely long pants will be the better choice.\n\nThe reason polo shirts or golf shirts work not just with their collars? The maneuverability factor is extremely important for golfing.\n\nIf you've never golfed before, you should probably watch a game or two just to see what golfers typically wear.\n\nIf you're not using a golf cart, even if you only play 9 holes instead of the full 18? You will want clothes that you can spend that much time walking in & then swinging your club & twisting as you do so & all those other details.\n\nHeck, even if you're just going to wind up at the driving range with a bucket or more of balls practicing/learning how to drive? You'll still at least want appropriate clothing, although maybe you might get away with utilitarian sneakers instead of golf shoes.\n\nBut if you're walking a golf course? Even just 9 holes? You'll be on grass that will be slick if you don't do the whole golf shoe thing. Also don't forget the bunkers that are also known as sand traps. That's moderate loose sand & sneakers might not get the job done if you wind up in one or more of those.\n\nAnd that doesn't even count or take into consideration the trees. Because if you hook or slice your ball into the trees? Your shorts will probably be less effective trying to locate a lost ball in the trees. Because your legs are exposed & that's not really tree ball hunt friendly.\n\nSorry about that. That kinda rains on your parade a little bit & pours a little cold water on things as well. But it's a spectacularly cute outfit overall as it is right now? Just feel like it's really not going to work for the golfing thing.\n\nBut you do have a cute outfit still and all so yeah, girl math wise you're still winning, even if it's not golfing appropriate wear.\n\nHope that helps? Good luck. It's not as easy as it looks I speak from some experience there. Even mini golf/miniature golfing I think you might want a different outfit than that one.\n\nBut if you're doing the golf course golf club thing then yes, you'll need to rethink the wardrobe for that because that one just probably isn't going to work.

So short hems or backless stuff is usually less respectful. \n\nBut an easy fix for the green dress would be to stitch the split - just in one spot, at the highest you want the split to go. Test while sitting down too. I’ve regretted wearing too-high a split before where it made sitting down instantly inappropriate/had to sit funny to avoid flashing anyone. \n\nAt the end of the day, you want to feel great and also don’t want anything to get in the way of you comfortably sitting, dancing, eating, or going to the bathroom.

I don't know that ironing it will make it less meh.)\n\nThe problem with any black dress aside from how it looks on you is that it is a silent negative response to the marriage in general and if you're there for either the bride or the groom, it can signal you're mourning their choice because black is typically associated with funerals in more formal settings like weddings.\n\n(My now former fiancee got married to a gentleman of mixed race and because her mom and step-dad disapproved of him, her mom showed up at her wedding in a black dress, and then left before the ceremony concluded, offering no communication with her daughter, because she was basically saying her daughter was dead to them as long as she remained married to him.)\n\nToo many potentially negative connotations with any black dress, unfortunately. And black is my favorite color but with a wedding the rules of fashion etiquette are not the same as other situations where black dresses would be appropriate.\n\nI like all the black dresses, don't misunderstand, please, it's just that, unless there's been a recent upheaval in the fashion rules for weddings? Black is just not ever appropriate, unfortunately.\n\nThe green dress is lovely but it's a bit too revealing to be appropriate for a wedding, so I would avoid choosing it.\n\nThe blue dress is very nice but it's also very subtle and it doesn't scream: \"look at me!\" I feel it's the best choice because it should allow you to blend in with the other wedding guests.\n\nAnd does not draw attention away from the bride, and that's really the primary fashion objective for female wedding guest clothing choices.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\n(The pink dress might have worked had it been a different color, other than black obviously.)", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1760034385, "created_iso": "2025-10-09T18:26:25+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "ninjfcv", "link_id": "t3_1o1fpe4", "parent_id": "t3_1o1fpe4", "author": "queseraseraphine", "body": "I love three!

Do you think it’s a secret that you’re bigger than he is? He knows. He loves you. Your friends know. Your friends love you. No one is going to look at these photos and go “wait a minute…is she bigger than he is? I can’t believe it! She tricked us all this time!” One photo from a weird angle isn’t going to bring some carefully constructed secret crashing down. \n\nI look moderately fat in my wedding photos. That’s because I am. I also look unbelievably happy, and that’s because I was. Those two things aren’t in conflict with each other. They’re just both true.\n\nI think a lot of plus-size people think they’re loved “despite” being bigger. I know a lot of plus-sized people spend their days always thinking ahead to One Day. As in, “One Day, I’ll be back to my ‘real’ size and I’ll fit back into my old jeans,” and “One Day, when I’m skinny, I’ll be able to do XYZ.” Except One Day isn’t real, or at least not guaranteed, and in the meantime, you have to live your life with the body you have. It’s like the Steinbeck quote about the poor thinking of themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires. What if this isn’t just the body you have until someday? What if this is the body you have right now, maybe forever, and it’s still worth honoring and enjoying? \n\nTake it from someone who hated herself a long time: if hating your body worked, it would’ve worked by now.

I would ask your photographer about it bc depending on where photos are being done one option might show better on camera! Like outdoor shoot with the green dress might not be the best. \n\nOn the photos part. TAKE THE PHOTOS. One thing I’ve realized is looking back at old photos I’m not critical about size just like happy about the memory and the people I was with. I chronically avoided photos and then realized how much I love looking back. Now my rule is to never say no to the photo or care at all in the moment. Then I just don’t look at the photo for a while like a year. I know I will hate it and be bummed out. When I look back a year later or just over time my love grows for the photo and the moment. I was in a friend’s wedding and spiraled about the photos. Felt a ton of shame bc I obviously would be the largest. I was forced to see a few and was so sad. Now 2 years later I look back at them often and have a photo from that day hung up. Just live in the moment and know you don’t have to look at them until you’re ready. Create the memory and worry about it later. Worrying about how you look in photos will come across in body language. Not trying to be harsh to you at all but I tell myself you’re fat and everyone knows it, sucking it in or wearing a sweater to hide your arms isn’t going to hide that you’re fat 😂 just so I don’t like do awkward weird things in pictures and be myself. Do the photoshoot as if you aren’t taking photos. Live in the moment with the person you love and focus on that happiness and him it will come across in photos! If you really end up hating them put them in a box and save them. Guarantee at some age you will look at those photos and be like I was so young and hot in this pictures I can’t believe I hated them! I HATED my grad photos and now realize they looked so good I just hated myself! Unlearning that is HARD but I find the coping mechanism of simply not looking and being oblivious until the photos have aged really helps 😂\n\n\nAlso in the time you have before the wedding wedding photos there are a few plus size creators that specifically make content on how to pose for pictures and stuff that can help prepare you like get some practice in so it comes natural and you might end up liking them more! Posing for photos to get the look we want is kind of an art to be studied and practiced if you want to try it! I find it helps me feel more prepared and confident when I do take photos. Again not going to FaceTime you to a size 2 but helps you look like yourself and not like insecure body posture or awkward. \n\n\nBest of luck to you and congratulations!

I must say that my overly gushing and fawning is because you remind me a very great deal of my last girlfriend.\n\nShe was a beautiful Latina lady, not quite half my age but about 27 years younger.\n\n[I'm 64 but was 59 when she and I met in person after falling in love in 2018. So she was about 32 and we were/are both people of size, or plus sized, as you and your hubster are. So we were not only a plus-sized couple, we were an interracial couple, and in an age-gap relationship.]\n\nI was not looking for love. I had my heart broken yet again by my now former fiancee, who had broken it once before back in the early 80s but I gave our relationship a 2nd try that lasted 9 years starting in 2003, but in the end she moved out in 2012 so I was just done with relationships and romantic entanglements of any kind.\n\nAnd I relocated to Arizona to get away from the chance of running into her anywhere accidentally.\n\nAnyway. The Latina lady you remind me so much of? I met her on a mutual friend's Facebook page. We got talking about sandwiches and what we love on them and I think more specifically we were talking about our favorite cheeses. Of all things. We both loved food obviously and loved to eat. She sent me a picture of herself and I fell in love immediately and hard.\n\nAs it turned out, she and my friend both lived in El Paso and not only had they met? They were friends but were also fellow musicians. So that worked to my advantage in that he knew she was real and I think they even got pictures together with his longtime girlfriend.\n\nOkay. So long story short [TOO LATE] we met in person back in 2019 after meeting in 2018 online. I'd already fallen ridiculously head over heels in love with her as I mentioned and when we finally got to be together for two weeks at the tail end of July first few days of August?\n\nThose were two of the happiest weeks of my life. And hers, she said. For some silly reason I only booked a one week stay but as the first week was coming to an end, neither one of us wanted me to leave. The chemistry was truly electric between us especially because I had not had any intention of ever falling in love ever again.\n\nStupid, silly Todd. The heart wants what it wants. But even after 2 heavenly weeks, I flew back to Phoenix and then went home to Prescott, 8 hours away, and we tried to keep doing the long distance relationship thing. That ultimately didn't work and was complicated by her on-going pursuit of rock stardom.\n\nI eventually managed to wreck things between us because that seems to be my curse. I'm not anywhere near as wise as your hubby is. Nowhere near that. So the relationship slid off the rails even though we stayed friends. Our chats became fewer and further between and, fast forward [haha] to 2024, she was diagnosed with cancer and lost her battle with it back in November.\n\nOut mutual friends gave me the news. After she passed and after the funeral was held for her. She didn't want me to \"drop everything\" to go be with her in the last few weeks of her life. Why?

Too much texture or color will compete with the pattern. For an event like that, I prefer to keep it clean and classic... To me that would likely mean black flats, black purse, and black belt. Black cardigan if it's cooler weather. For me personally I'd probably do simple jewelry, either silver or gold, or diamond studs.\n\nBut with all outfits, and all events, the most important part is that you are true to your personal style and your outfit makes you FEEL how you want to feel (cute, professional, outgoing, etc.). Most of the time, I want to feel \"put together\", and my advice definitely reflects that. If that feels too stuffy for you, I think a denim jacket and loafers could be cute, too, if the event is more on the casual side of things.\n\nBest of luck! I hope you have fun.

In your case, to flatter your body type, you should not add horizontal lines to the mid-torso. \n\nThe hem of the ruffle, the belt area, the lack of \"ease\" (extra space) in the belly area, and the patterned light fabric... combine to basically make this one of the worst options for you.\n\nEssentially, I can not tell clearly where the bust ends and the waist begins.

However it can flatter you quite nicely with a little styling. \n\n(1) Lift and support the girls. If you have'em, flaunt'em. Some strapless bras can be paired with clear straps to help with  support. \n\n(2) Raise the sides of the ruffle higher on your shoulder. You currently have them in a position that narrows your shoulders while widening your upper arms. Squaring the neckline can also allow you to wear a regular-strapped bra if strapless simply doesn't work for you. Just pin the dress to the straps to keep them from playing peekaboo all day. \n\n(3) Add a cute chunky belt to the outfit. Gingham (it looks like it without my glasses on) is a very repetitive pattern and can be a bit much without something to break it up visually. I would go with solid black for the belt on this one. White or metal won't have the desired impact. Black is subtle but will still look intentional.\n\n(4) Accessories!! A long strand or two of black beads (like a strand of pearls but in black) would look fabulous with this. If you can find earrings that look like a bead cut in half of about the same size as the beads on the necklace, that would be a perfect pairing. Add a white straw tote bag, oversized sunshades, strappy sandals or comfortable wedges and you have a fantastic outfit.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1758864387, "created_iso": "2025-09-26T05:26:27+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "ngaqc7t", "link_id": "t3_1noo06m", "parent_id": "t3_1noo06m", "author": "xunholylaurenx", "body": "I would honestly find a dress with a higher waist like an empire dress.

I also always wear leggings for some basic protection (these are some Torrid Nightfall size 3s) although jeans are my default for longer rides.\n\nThe black zip up I’m wearing is a Bohn Armor Armored mesh riding shirt in a women’s 4XL. It’s hard to find good armored tops for plus size women but this one works really well and offers a lot of protection (back, elbows, shoulders) in case of an accident. It’s also light enough you can wear under a sweater in the winter. Finally the helmet is a custom painted Sedici Sistema 3 Parlare (3XL)\n\nWhen I first decided I wanted to learn to ride a bike, I was very concerned about whether I’d fine gear that fit me well.

{"id": "1njp9i8", "subreddit": "PlusSizeFashion", "created_utc": 1758143098, "created_iso": "2025-09-17T21:04:58+00:00", "title": "Reminders, Clarifications, General Plea from the Mods 😅", "selftext": "Hi all! \n\nMaybe this could just be titled the “Seasonal Newsletter”. 🤣 Anywho, just wanted to touch on some things that have frequently come up in the mod queue and overall in the sub. \n\nFirst of all! CONGRATS TO YOU ALL. We reached 100k+ members recently and we’re happy to see the growth of the sub overall. 🎉 \n\ntl;dr: Remember to still follow the rules as the seasons change and overall. Links in posts or comments MUST BE PLUS SIZE INCLUSIVE. If it doesn’t at the very minimum go up to a 3X, we don’t want it. And please, no booty shots. Save it for your camera roll. \n\n______________________\n\nNow, hold onto your seatbelts as we address a few things. 😬 \n\nWith fall coming up (for the northerners), that means the ever infamous Halloween costumes will be making their debut. We love to seem them BUT they still need to comply with sub rules. \n\nThis means no heavily sexualized costumes, lingerie (we know you’re a hardcore girl…”duh I’m a mouse”), or nudity (actual or implied). Costumes need to be rated E, for everyone. If you wouldn’t answer the door to pass out candy in it…please reconsider posting it here. Thank you! \n\nFor our southern friends, swimsuits will be coming out of the closet and as always we do allow them here with our specific rules in mind. No booties out, no see through items, and no barely there looks. Act like you’re going to Disney, not a nude beach. 😬\n_________________________\n\nAnother hot topic that we are going to crack down more on. Links that you share MUST BE PLUS SIZE INCLUSIVE. The bare absolute minimum would be at least to a 3X. But please, if you are posting a link that only offers up to a size XL, it’s frankly, not helpful. If you can find a similar product that has extended size ranges then by all means, share that to help. But we really need to be more intentional with our links and posts that we share. \n\nAnd personally, I totally get fitting into a range of sizes. I can even sometimes wear a L up top. But I also know, those photos I take wearing it, don’t need to be shared here. While we can’t police every item that someone chooses to wear and/or post. We challenge some to think before posting. If what you are wearing/sharing is a XL and you know this, share it to r/midsizefashion. \n\nWhen most people post, others are understandably going to want to know where you get things from. That’s the whole point of the sub. But when it doesn’t even come in their size range…it’s kind of a waste. I can’t even tell you the amount of times I’ve clicked a link for a cute dress only to see it goes up to an XL and get so defeated. And I’m what some would consider the lower end of plus size. It’s hard out here. Let’s help each other out. \n\nI don’t say this to be rude or mean but to just get people to think a little and to please be more intentional and inclusive. \n_________________\n\nAnd to bounce off the topic of intentionality, please, please, please. Stop posting your booties. We can’t see the actual outfit half the time.  \n\nUnless it’s a photo of you frolicking through a field of flowers in a magical dress, or there’s so much intricate detail that just needs to be shared that’s on the back of your shirt. We don’t need to see a photo of you from behind. Of course those are just examples but you get the point. \n\nPlease just be mindful of what you post. It makes the sub flow smoothly and makes our days as mods just a little bit easier. \n_____________________\n\nAs always, we are open to feedback and any questions you have. Happy season changes and we are excited to see the sub continue to grow! \n\nCheers 🥂 ", "author": "lexi2700", "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 8, "link_flair_text": "Announcement", "over_18": false, "is_self": true, "removed_by": null, "edited": true, "distinguished": "moderator", "stickied": true, "awards": [], "comments": [{"id": "nesiofk", "link_id": "t3_1njp9i8", "parent_id": "t3_1njp9i8", "author": "SeasonPositive6771", "body": "Thanks for the 3X rule!", "score": 61, "created_utc": 1758150154, "created_iso": "2025-09-17T23:02:34+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "netb88j", "link_id": "t3_1njp9i8", "parent_id": "t3_1njp9i8", "author": "FattierBrisket", "body": "I really hope people follow the size inclusive rule!!

As we don’t encourage private messages unless someone states it okay. But overall we’re also trying to curb the content overall to really focus on plus sizes. Just overall, it’s unhelpful to the sub as a whole to show a styled outfit and it not be obtainable for a majority of the sub. Hopefully that makes sense. It’s why we created the midsize group in fact. As a way for people to share items kind of interchangeably. Even myself, if I’m wearing a 2X or 3X I will share it here. But if my outfit consisted of an XL I go to midsize instead to share it. I’ve done this tons of times and I just feel it’s helpful to share with the subreddit audience in mind. \n\nWe try to curb selfies. So if you see a post with tons of them attached (like more than 50%) feel free to report it. We have a “no face centric photos” rule for this. Because people would argue that any self photo is a selfie so we had to be specific. 😬 We also try to catch them pretty quickly if we see them as the first photo in a series must be a full body shot. It’s fine if the second photo is more of selfie but it just can’t be the first one that’s shown. It’s kind of the happy medium we’re going with at the moment. But please feel free to report any posts you think need looked at. Usually if someone only posts one outfit photo and like 6 selfies, it will get removed because it defeats the purpose. Plus in the removal it does give them links to the r/plussizeselfies sub. So they have the option given to them.

Multiple lengths helps, e.g. full length, 7/8 and capri, same again for sports bras, that band vs bust is not a one size fits all, hello H cup and B cup ladies both trying a \"3XL\" which fits neither of you. \n\n*Leggings*: Lack of pockets at the side of the leg, weird shaped waistlines causing it to slide down or sit weirdly on fat, low crotches (may work for different body shapes though) anything that feels like brushed cotton/velvet/fleece to touch (last one is niche due to a touch sensitivity issue - anyone who can't touch velvet knows what I mean). \n\n*Sports bras*: While racerbacks provide great support, I end up with back bulge in weird places, straps are often way too long or loose over shoulders, and boobs often get smushed at the front and there's no underarm/side control so the fat just spills out towards the armpits, also removable cups (they feel so good once in place, but ALWAYS fold over during washing/storing and it's maddening to get them to flatten out through that tiny side hole). \n\n*Tops*: Always designed to hug that belly fat for everyone to see.

People are there to see the multimedia experience that is a Weird Al concert.

Attached to this post is a picture of me and the man himself! \n\nI was really worried that this dress was too tight, or that it was not flattering on my body. I am a visually impaired trans woman. Sometimes I struggle a bit with knowing if an outfit looks good on me. But, my wife kept telling me that my dress looked really cute on me and that I should absolutely wear it to the concert if I felt like it. \n\nI really wanted to wear this dress because it was unique, and a little weird, and I'm a huge fan of telephones… Especially the old vintage ones. \n\nOne of my first Weird Al songs was Phony Calls from the Bad Hair Day album. \n\nI wish that I hadn't been so shy around Al when I met him, I would have loved it to have told him of the significance of this dress. But, when the time came, I could barely speak. It was such a surreal experience getting to meet him.\n\nAnyway, I found this dress on Etsy. I really like it and I hope to wear it to other events.

You really want flexibility with layers, you probably for the first week want pants or shorts or a romper. Save the cute outfits for after class or until you know what classes are cute outfit safe. Some will not be. Some will require a specific dress code like in labs. Have fun and don't worry what people think about your outfits. By the end of the month everyone will be rolling out of bed late and putting the first thing they see on that doesn't smell. ", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1757454682, "created_iso": "2025-09-09T21:51:22+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "ndcbtt2", "link_id": "t3_1nct9sz", "parent_id": "t3_1nct9sz", "author": "Minxionnaire", "body": "I do love dresses but just know that it’s something to be mindful of everytime you have to go upstairs, strong breezes, rushing to class, skin on chairs etc. I’m recalling those moments for me lol  \n\nBut if you still want to, maybe some bike shorts under!

They are so cute but as my eye traveled down I did not expect them to be so long, I think breaking them right before your shoe/ankle would create visual interest, balance, and nice *intention* to the look. \n\n- make the shirt smaller! I know you're not super comfy with crop tops yet, but I think this shirt being slightly more fitted and a little more cropped would also bring something to this look. For instance, my eye is drawn to the fact that the sleeve is sort of a cap sleeve but is tenting off your shoulder/arm. The folds in the shirt below your bust signal that there is an excess of fabric but it's not an oversized fit (big bust woes). Maybe you can use a small hair tie to just gather the tiniest amount of the shirt in the back, which would make it a little snugger and raise it up a bit?

I really do think you’re hitting a good balance with your outfits. I’d suggest wearing more accessories. A statement earring, a fun necklace, a belt with a funky buckle, a cool hair clip, hell even a nice Apple Watch band can significantly change the vibe of an outfit. I’d also suggest investing in a pair or two of high quality but comfy loafers or flats, maybe even a small heel. That way you can be comfortable while running all over a conference center!\n\n[Target](https://www.target.com/c/accessories/-/N-4ylcv) has some cool accessories at a decent price, especially their wild fable and universal thread lines. [Chunks](https://chunks.shop/?srsltid=AfmBOorFTN_LbWs4JsiBUCP3UwowdMqAFKhFlJuMaGg6kYen3UseijwX) has some rad hair accessories. [Francesca’s](https://francescas.com/category/new-arrivals/new-jewelry) also has cool accessories. Don’t be afraid to also go to local boutiques and thrift stores too to find some unique pieces!\n\nI think the first suggestion I have to address the problems you asked about is to get fitted for a bra by a professional. That may help with the “boobs hanging out” (lmao) problem. Also, maybe consider a minimizer if you really feel they are getting in the way. That way, they’ll be super secure.\n\nFor the polos, I think the goal would be to make the rest of the outfit as cool as possible. Maybe a cool patterned pant and a blazer or a vest? Fun shoes and accessories, too. I also think tucking in a polo and having a belt helps with the frumpiness a lot of plus size women get when wearing a polo, because it defines you at the waist. \n\nI don’t work in the fitness sphere, but I can empathize that it is hard to be in a room of people who are smaller and be confident, and I bet that’s only amplified in the rooms you are in. But if you are going to all these conferences, you obviously worked hella hard to be there. You deserve to be there just as much as anyone else. And by being there, you are showing the people in those rooms that plus size people can and should be apart of those conversations. Super proud of you for putting yourself out there.

I can't even wear the types of shoes I used to. \n\n\nI do have a dress & a skirt which are very much my style. The long black skirt has side splits going up to about halfway between knees and top of leg.

I rlly wish I could wear these 2 things that are so much more \"me\" than the rest of my wardrobe. \n\n\nThing is, I think fat people are gorgeous. Tbh, I've always found fat guys & gals more attractive than their thin counterparts. Even back when I was a size 8/10. But I'm not one of them. I don't look right. I wish I could get to the point that I didn't care how others felt about my body. But I'm already judged so harshly for being visibly crippled/disabled, and having a messed up face, it's like I don't wanna invite more criticism, because I have enough to deal with.

You'd even dress fancy to get on a plane. \n\nMy son's school requires a uniform of any color polo (not more than two colors) and khakis (navy or khaki color) with a belt (brown or black) to teach professionalism to all childrwn of all sizes, races, economic background, ages, etc. and not to wear workout gear when not working out or pj's when not sleeping. It just looks more professional, socially acceptable, and like a little effort was put in. \n\nAgain, that's my opinion. My son is not overweight, either. I think a lot of people in certain groups tend to look at things through a lens of their group involvement being the reason for something when it's not the reason or even exclusive to their group at all.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1756758583, "created_iso": "2025-09-01T20:29:43+00:00", "is_submitter": false, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null}, {"id": "nbbd3yg", "link_id": "t3_1n37jk8", "parent_id": "t1_nbbcjyb", "author": "Sea_Spaghetti_8774", "body": "Thank you!

I am a plus size middle aged woman who is opening my home to my niece who has been neglected horribly, to the point of it being abusive. She owns one pair of pants and one shirt. No underwear or bras. She is almost 24. One pair of croc like shoes. She is almost 6’ tall and weighs around 350lbs (according to her best guess) she hasn’t been able to wash her clothes or shower so they smell awful and I hope to get them clean so I can take her shopping if she feels comfortable enough to do that. She is a bit agoraphobic after being shut in for so long so we will most likely need to shop online or I can go thrifting for her. She is traumatized and I don’t want to stress her out by making her come with me. She feels so ashamed of her body and it breaks my heart. \n\nDoes anyone have recommendations on how I can shop for her and get her the right size without pulling out a measuring tape? I ordered her some 3xl underwear and they should arrive tomorrow. I want to help her make friends with her body and feel good about how she looks so she will be more open to going out and socializing. I am disabled so I have to be very budget conscious and I don’t want her to feel like a burden which is part of how she was conditioned in her former home. \n\nI don’t want to order the wrong size and have her be embarrassed if the clothes don’t fit. She carries most of her weight in the middle, and is thick everywhere but her back and stomach are the thickest. I really want her to be happy with what we get, not just say she is happy but actually be happy.  I have a sun sensitivity so my clothes are boring sun safe stuff that I need to wear but wouldn’t really choose otherwise and I am a size 18 so my stuff won’t fit her. \n\nWhere can I get her something casual and fun online that won’t break the bank. \n\nThank you in advance!

Do they fit well or are they too loose/snug? Is she comfortable in those items? If so, try to procure similar items. Keep the comfort zone close for now. Then once you have some basic pieces in rotation, you can hopefully enjoy the fun shopping!

I might suggest doing this with her first; take her to places like Old Navy, Macy's, Kohl's, Torrid, and have her try on clothes there. Jeans, shirts, skirts, dresses. Become familiar with the brands she tries on, and keep a record of what styles & sizes were most comfortable. This will help so much with online shopping & thrifting. Measuring herself and writing down her measurements will help with online shopping as well. I also suggest getting a bra fitting - most women are wearing the wrong bra size. \n\nAlso, when looking at pants/skirts, have her wrap the waistline of pants/skirt around her neck. If the waistline meets comfortably at the back of her neck, the pants/skirt are likely to fit.

Most 12s are 42 so just a cm too small. So when I ordered from CS I got a 13 because the size chart said they’d be 44 but they really fit like a 42.

I wish I'd gotten this blazer in the right size (one down, an S/16) as the oversized boyfriend blazer doesnt tend to work for me, but its nice to be comfy. \n\nI also liked the red blazer with chocolate pants this week, and the cinnamon pants with the pink top. As always, everything is City Chic unless otherwise specified. \n\nI got 4 new scrunchies from a local market and love love love the green faux leather one!\n\nNew nails in the palest pink with a bit of glitter. Lip gloss in most of these pics is Rimmel Oh My Gloss in 330 Snog, my absolute favourite.
